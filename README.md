**Currently developing a V2 of this project.**

:package:**School - Modelleren automation**

:pencil:**Summary:**  
One of the parts of this class is comparing things to eachother.
an example would be 1 needs to be compared to 2, 3, 4, 5 so this
means 2 needs to be compared to 3, 4, 5. 
When using small numbers like this you could do this easily by hand,
but if you'd need to compare 30 different things that would take a lot of time
to write down.
So I made the project to save time.


:children_crossing:**Use:**
1. Open excel.
2. Open modelleren.exe.
3. Set your excel up so that you have the starting cell selected
4. When you've opened modelleren.exe you'll get asked how many camparisons you need to make, enter the amount
5. After you've entered you've got 2s to ALT+Tab back into excel, after which the program will take care of the rest

:rotating_light:**WARNING**:rotating_light:  
Do not alt tab anywhere untill the program is done.
